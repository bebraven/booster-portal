# Adjust some settings for dev
# - Set the dev encryption key hash so that dev passwords are encrypted using a dev value.
# - Set the dev access token and access token hint, used for other apps to be able to call into the Canvas API.
# - Make the timeout to wait for the SSO server 15 seconds since dev can be slow, especially on first start.
# - Disable Canvas analytics which relies on a Cassandra DB. No need for this and it clutter the error log.
